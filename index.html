                    <p>
                        When I started senior high school, I chose the ICT strand due to my interest in computers and the growing demand in the tech industry. I began learning basic programming, which led me to pursue an Information Technology degree in college. <br> There, I advanced my programming skills and developed a management system.
                        In my final year, I worked as a freelance programmer, primarily creating management systems using PHP. This experience taught me valuable skills in client communication, time management, and independent problem-solving. <br>         
                        Now, I aim to secure a position where I can leverage my strong foundation in programming and networking, gain hands-on experience, and contribute to a forward-thinking IT environment. Driven by a passion for technology and continuous learning, I look forward to bringing my skills and dedication to your organization.
